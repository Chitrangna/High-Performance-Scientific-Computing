trapezoidal and monte Carlo methods - serial and parallel code  

hw2 - Create two matrices, A and B, each of size (N × N). Initialise the matrices to random
floating point numbers. Write an OpenMP and MPI code for computing C = AB and then
transforming C into an upper triangular matrix. Vary the size of the problem from N = 100 . . . 10000.  

hw3 - Create two matrices, A and B, each of size (N × N). Write a CUDA code for computing C = AB. Vary the size of
the problem from N = 100 . . . 10000.
