# Parallelized State Estimation

Our project implements the famous Kalman filter in pytorch, using the recursive formulation. It may be run on CPU or GPU, and it outputs the various measures of importance. To keep things simple, the report only contains plots of True vs Filtered States.

Implementation was done by Aryan Agal, Chitrangna Bhatt and Siddhesh Pawar of the Department of Energy Science, IIT Bombay, as part of the course ME766, High Performance Spaceflight Computing running at IIT Bombay.
